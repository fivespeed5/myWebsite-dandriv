            <h2>Importance of Understanding Number System</h2>
            <p>Understanding number systems is important because they form the backbone of computer science and digital electronics, enabling efficient data storage and manipulation. They are essential for programming, as different systems like binary and hexadecimal are widely used in coding and debugging. Additionally, they facilitate conversions and computations in algorithms, making them critical for problem-solving.

            <h3>Binary Number System</h3>
            <p>The Binary system uses only two digits, 0 and 1. It is the basis of all modern computing systems. Each digit is referred to as a bit.</p>

            <h3>Decimal Number System</h3>
            <p>The Decimal system is the standard system for denoting integer and non-integer numbers. It is based on the number 10 and uses digits from 0 to 9.</p>

            <h3>Octal Number System</h3>
            <p>The Octal system uses base 8, meaning it consists of digits from 0 to 7. It is often used in computing as a more compact representation of binary numbers.</p>

            <h3>Hexadecimal Number System</h3>
            <p>The Hexadecimal system uses base 16. It uses digits from 0 to 9 and letters A to F, where A represents 10 and F represents 15. It is widely used in programming and digital electronics.</p>
