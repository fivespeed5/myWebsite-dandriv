                    Hello! I’m Dandriv P. Duba, a passionate first-year student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology
                     at the University of Cebu, Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue. Born and raised in the vibrant city of Liloan, Cebu,
                     I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and problem-solving.

                     I specialize in building user-friendly applications and websites, driven by the philosophy that great software should be
                      both functional and intuitive. I enjoy working with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React, 
                      as well as diving into back-end development with languages like C programming, and more. 
                      While I’m still in the early stages of my development journey,
                      my goal is to constantly learn new languages, tools, and frameworks to improve my versatility as a developer.
                </p>

            <p id="goals">
                As I continue my studies at the University of Cebu, my ambition is to master various programming languages, 
                explore more advanced topics in software architecture, and contribute to open-source projects.
                I’m excited to take on new challenges, collaborate with other like-minded developers, 
                and use technology to solve real-world problems.
